This is a https://brew.sh[Homebrew] tap containing software that I use for
evaluating student submissions of C- and C++-language source code.
You can install http://trombonehero.github.io/libgrading[libgrading] by running either:

```terminal
$ brew install trombonehero/homebrew-grading/libgrading
```

or

```terminal
$ brew tap trombonehero/homebrew-grading
$ brew install libgrading
```
